I'm currently diving into the world of programming as part of MIT Emerging Talent
Program in Computer and Data Science. With a background in chemical engineering,
I'm now expanding my skill set into programming, AI, and data science.

## Programming Journey

As a beginner in programming, I’m fascinated by the logical and mathematical
aspects of coding, and I’m eager to apply these principles in the tech world.
I’m currently focusing on Python, tackling projects, and learning through MIT's
courses. My ultimate goal is to use programming and data science as tools to
solve real-world problems, bridging the gap between my engineering and tech expertise.

## Other interests in Programming

I’m deeply interested in the intersection of AI and human intelligence. I believe
humans' ability to understand and reason sets us apart. Sir Roger Penrose’s argument
that _Understanding_ transcends pure computation resonates with me deeply. I aim
to explore these differences further in my tech journey.

## Goals & Roadmap

I’m on a journey to become proficient in Python and data science. In the next year,
I aim to complete key projects and gain hands-on experience with various tools. This
README will evolve as I progress, reflecting my learning and growth. I think it's
fitting to think of my programming skills as a markdown code being updated over time.
