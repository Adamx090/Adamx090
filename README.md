## Programming History

I am a complete novice at programming, but I believe that I have a natural affinity
towards it. I regard myself as an abstract thinker. I love logic, math and philosophy.
Although, my engineering background gives me a pragmatic side as well, so applied
programming is not out of the question.  

I applied for and successfully enrolled in MIT Emerging Talent Program for Computer
and Data Science - Foundation Track, in an attempt to professionally develop my
programming skills.

## Hot Philosophical Takes

### AI VS. Humans: Can AI Surpass us?  

Many believe that AI surpassing human intelligence is inevitable.
**Personally, I disagree**!  

AI, and computers in general, excel at computation and following algorithms.
In fact, machines have outperformed humans in these areas for decades.
However, the defining trait that elevated humans to the top isn’t raw
computational power, it’s their ability to understand.  

Renowned mathematician and Nobel laureate Sir Roger Penrose has argued that
Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem reveals a fundamental limitation of computation.
According to Penrose, understanding transcends pure computation
 > Understanding, whatever that word means, is not computational.  
 > _Sir Roger Penrose_  

I wholeheartedly agree. Take axioms as an example. **Axioms** are foundational
truths that humans understand without proof, and they guide our reasoning.
While computers can operate based on axioms, they do so without actually
understanding them. Humans must provide these axioms, which highlights a
fundamental limitation: computers depend on human input for meaning.  

Exploring the fundamental differences between human intelligence and artificial
intelligence is one of the many reasons I got interested in computer science.  

## Other Interests

Apart from everything I already mentioned, I am a chess enthusiast, which makes
the timing of writing this especially exciting for me, as the 2024 World Chess
Championship is currently ongoing.  

## Parting Thoughts  

I intend to  work hard to rapidly improve my programming skills. While doing so,
I shall keep updating this README profile through sequential commits which Github
will chronicle. I think it's fitting to think of my programming skill as a
markdown code that keeps improving over time.
